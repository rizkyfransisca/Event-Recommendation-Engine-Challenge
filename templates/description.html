<p>We (the competition hosts) are excited to sponsor the Event Recommendation Engine Challenge, which asks you to predict what events our users will be interested in based on events they’ve responded to in the past, user demographic information, and what events they’ve seen and clicked on in our app. The insights you discover from this data, and the algorithms the winners create, will allow us to improve our event recommendation algorithm, a core part of our applications and a key element in improving user experience.</p>


<h5>Dataset Description</h5>
<p>There are six files in all: <b>train.csv</b>, <b>test.csv</b>, <b>users.csv</b>, <b>user_friends.csv</b>, <b>events.csv</b>, and <b>event_attendees.csv</b>.</p>

<p><b>train.csv</b> has six columns:  <b>user</b>, <b>event</b>, <b>invited</b>, <b>timestamp</b>, <b>interested</b>, and <b>not_interested</b>.  <b>test.csv</b> contains the same columns as train.csv, except for interested and not_interested. Each row corresponds to an event that was shown to a user in our application.  <b>event</b> is an id identifying an event in a our system.  <b>user</b> is an id representing a user in our system.  <b>invited</b> is a binary variable indicated whether the user has been invited to the event. <b>timestamp</b> is a ISO-8601 UTC time string representing the approximate time (+/- 2 hours) when the user saw the event in our application. <b>interested</b> is a binary variable indicating whether a user clicked on the "Interested" button for this event; it is 1 if the user clicked Interested and 0 if the user did not click the button.  Similarly, <b>not_interested</b> is a binary variable indicating whether a user clicked on the "Not Interested" button for this event; it is 1 if the user clicked the button and 0 if not.  It is possible that the user saw an event and clicked neither Interested nor Not Interested, and hence there are rows that contain 0,0 as values for <b>interested,not_interested</b>.</p>

<p><b>users.csv</b> contains demographic data about our some of our users (including all of the users appearing in the train and test files), and it has the following columns: <b>user_id</b>, <b>locale</b>, <b>birthyear</b>, <b>gender</b>, <b>joinedAt</b>, <b>location</b>, and <b>timezone</b>. <b>user_id</b> is the id of the user in our system.  <b>locale</b> is a string representing the user's locale, which should be of the form language_territory. <b>birthyear</b> is a 4-digit integer representing the year when the user was born. <b>gender</b> is either male or female, depending on the user's gender.  <b>joinedAt</b> is an ISO-8601 UTC time string representing when the user first used our application.  <b>location</b> is a string representing the user's location (if known).  timezone is a signed integer representing the user's UTC offset (in minutes).</p>

<p><b>user_friends.csv</b> contains social data about this user, and contains two columns:  user and friends.  <b>user</b> is the user's id in our system, and <b>friends</b> is a space-delimited list of the user's friends' ids.</p>

<p><b>events.csv</b> contains data about events in our system, and has 110 columns.  The first nine columns are <b>event_id</b>, <b>user_id</b>, <b>start_time</b>, <b>city</b>, <b>state</b>, <b>zip</b>, <b>country</b>, <b>lat</b>, and <b>lng</b>.  <b>event_id</b> is the id of the event, and <b>user_id</b> is the id of the user who created the event.  <b>city</b>, <b>state</b>, <b>zip</b>, and <b>country</b> represent more details about the location of the venue (if known).  <b>lat</b> and <b>lng</b> are floats representing the latitude and longitude coordinates of the venue, rounded to three decimal places.  <b>start_time</b> is the ISO-8601 UTC time string representing when the event is scheduled to begin.  The last 101 columns require a bit more explanation; first, we determined the 100 most common word stems (obtained via Porter Stemming) occuring in the name or description of a large random subset of our events.  The last 101 columns are <b>count_1</b>, <b>count_2</b>, ..., <b>count_100</b>, <b>count_other</b>, where <b>count_N</b> is an integer representing the number of times the Nth most common word stem appears in the name or description of this event.  <b>count_other</b> is a count of the rest of the words whose stem wasn't one of the 100 most common stems.</p>

<p><b>event_attendees.csv</b> contains information about which users attended various events, and has the following columns: <b>event_id</b>, <b>yes</b>, <b>maybe</b>, <b>invited</b>, and <b>no</b>. <b>event_id</b> identifies the event. <b>yes/b>, <b>maybe</b>, <b>invited</b>, and <b>no</b> are space-delimited lists of user id's representing users who indicated that they were going, maybe going, invited to, or not going to the event.</p>
