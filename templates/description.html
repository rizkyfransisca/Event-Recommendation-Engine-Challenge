<p>We (the competition hosts) are excited to sponsor the Event Recommendation Engine Challenge, which asks you to predict what events our users will be interested in based on events they’ve responded to in the past, user demographic information, and what events they’ve seen and clicked on in our app. The insights you discover from this data, and the algorithms the winners create, will allow us to improve our event recommendation algorithm, a core part of our applications and a key element in improving user experience.</p>
